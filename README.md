===========

FOR EVERYONE:
  You can find all of the code we went over during enhancement here.  We'll try to keep it as up-to-date as possible.
  \nIf you need a local (on your own hard drive) copy, you can download it as a .zip with the button at the bottom-right on the main page.
  
FOR JOHN, ADAM, AND SAM:
  For each club day, make a folder with the date as the title.
  Include comments in the code wherever you feel is nessecary.
